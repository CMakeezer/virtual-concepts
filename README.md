Dynamic Generic Programming with Virtual Concepts
================

This is a research project aimed at introducing <u>language support for type erasure in C++</u>.

The "draft" folder currently contains a version of what is meant to become a proposal for standardization - or a larger document to be referred from such a proposal. The "code" folder contains examples included in (or referenced from) the draft.

The draft currently contains a brief introduction and a section that provides an overview of the existing solutions for Dynamic Generic Programming (DGP) in C++.

There is a dedicated thread on std-proposals: https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/forum/#!topic/std-proposals/4gEt2OBbSQM.

Any feedback is most welcome.
