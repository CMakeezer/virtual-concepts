Dynamic Generic Programming with Virtual Concepts
================

This is a research project aimed at introducing _language support for type erasure in C++_.

The `draft` folder currently contains a version of what is meant to become a proposal for standardization - or a larger document to be referred from such a proposal. The `code` folder contains examples included in (or referenced from) the draft.

The draft currently contains:

* A brief introduction and motivation;
* A section that provides an overview of the existing solutions for Dynamic Generic Programming (DGP) in C++;
* A section stating the design goals for this project;
* A section demonstrating some practical applications of virtual concepts.

There is a [dedicated thread on std-proposals](https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/forum/#!topic/std-proposals/4gEt2OBbSQM.) for discussion. Any feedback is most welcome.
